In fact I\u2019d argue that the only way that something is meant to be if you\u2019re willing to commit to the difficulty in life otherwise it wasn\u2019t meant to be anything but just a missed opportunity it will be a difficult road but here\u2019s what we come to learn everything of value is difficult",
